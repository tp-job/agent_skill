# Skill Creator

A skill for creating new skills and iteratively improving them.

At a high level, the process of creating a skill goes like this:

- Decide what you want the skill to do and roughly how it should do it

- Write a draft of the skill

- Create a few test prompts and run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on them

- Help the user evaluate the results both qualitatively and quantitatively

  - While the runs happen in the background, draft some quantitative evals if there aren't any (if there are some, you can either use as is or modify if you feel something needs to change about them). Then explain them to the user (or if they already existed, explain the ones that already exist)
   - Baseline the current skill first, then change one rule at a time, so a difference can be attributed
   - Show the user the before/after outputs for the cases that changed, not just a summary score. The loop is in **Running and evaluating test cases** below

- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results (and also if there are any glaring flaws that become apparent from the quantitative benchmarks)

- Repeat until you're satisfied

- Expand the test set and try again at larger scale

Your job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through these stages. So for instance, maybe they're like "I want to make a skill for X". You can help narrow down what they mean, write a draft, write the test cases, figure out how they want to evaluate, run all the prompts, and repeat.

On the other hand, maybe they already have a draft of the skill. In this case you can go straight to the eval/iterate part of the loop.

Of course, you should always be flexible and if the user is like "I don't need to run a bunch of evaluations, just vibe with me", you can do that instead.

Then after the skill is done (but again, the order is flexible), you can also run the skill description improver, which we have a whole separate script for, to optimize the triggering of the skill.

Cool? Cool.

## Communicating with the user

The skill creator is liable to be used by people across a wide range of familiarity with coding jargon. If you haven't heard (and how could you, it's only very recently that it started), there's a trend now where the power of Claude is inspiring plumbers to open up their terminals, parents and grandparents to google "how to install npm". On the other hand, the bulk of users are probably fairly computer-literate.

So please pay attention to context cues to understand how to phrase your communication! In the default case, just to give you some idea:

- "evaluation" and "benchmark" are borderline, but OK

- for "JSON" and "assertion" you want to see serious cues from the user that they know what those things are before using them without explaining them

It's OK to briefly explain terms if you're in doubt, and feel free to clarify terms with a short definition if you're unsure if the user will get it.

## Creating a skill

### Capture Intent

Start by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say "turn this into a skill"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.

1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?

2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)

3. What's the expected output format?

4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.

### Interview and Research

Proactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.

Check available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.

### Write the SKILL.md

Based on the user interview, fill in these components:

- **name**: Skill identifier

- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All "when to use" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to "undertrigger" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit "pushy". So for instance, instead of "How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.", you might write "How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'"

- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)

- **the rest of the skill :)**

### Skill Writing Guide

#### Anatomy of a Skill

```

skill-name/

├── SKILL.md (required)

│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)

│   └── Markdown instructions

└── Bundled Resources (optional)

    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks

    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed

    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)

```

#### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:

1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)

2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)

3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)

These word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.

**Key patterns:**

- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.

- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them

- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents

**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:

```

cloud-deploy/

├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)

└── references/

    ├── aws.md

    ├── gcp.md

    └── azure.md

```

Claude reads only the relevant reference file.

#### Principle of Lack of Surprise

This goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a "roleplay as an XYZ" are OK though.

#### Writing Patterns

Prefer using the imperative form in instructions.

**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:

```markdown

## Report structure

ALWAYS use this exact template:

# [Title]

## Executive summary

## Key findings

## Recommendations

```

**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if "Input" and "Output" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):

```markdown

## Commit message format

**Example 1:**

Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens

Output: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

```

### Writing Style

Try to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.

### Test Cases

After writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] "Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?" Then run them.

Save test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.

```json

{

  "skill_name": "example-skill",

  "evals": [

    {

      "id": 1,

      "prompt": "User's task prompt",

      "expected_output": "Description of expected result",

      "files": []

    }

  ]

}

```

See [schemas](references/schemas.md) for the full schema (including the `assertions` field, which you'll add later).

## Running and evaluating test cases

**This loop runs with no tooling beyond what you already have.** An earlier version of this
skill described an automated harness — `run_eval.py`, `generate_review.py`, `benchmark.js`,
`package_skill.py` and fourteen more — and **none of those scripts ship with this skill**. The
instructions were unrunnable, which meant the one skill whose job is fixing skills could not
execute its own process. The manual loop below is what actually works. If you later build the
automated harness, replace this section wholesale rather than letting the two drift.

### Step 1 — Write the cases before you touch the skill

A test case is a **prompt plus the observable thing the revised skill must do**. Write both
halves before editing, for the same reason a feature's verification steps are written before its
code: afterwards, cases get quietly shaped to fit whatever the skill already says.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `prompt` | What the user would actually type, in their own words |
| `context` | The repo or environment state that makes this case interesting |
| `expected` | The **observable** behaviour — a question asked, a file checked, a refusal |
| `failure_mode` | What the skill did *before* the fix, so a regression is recognisable |

The best cases come from real failures. A skill that has been used in anger has a list of them
already: every place it produced something wrong is a case with a known correct answer.

### Step 2 — Establish the baseline honestly

Run each prompt **against the current skill** and write down what happens, before changing
anything. Without this you cannot tell an improvement from a coincidence.

If subagents are available, spawn one per case so each runs without your context — you wrote the
skill, so running it yourself is the weakest possible test. If they are not available, run the
cases yourself but read the skill fresh and follow it literally, including steps you would
normally skip. Note in the results which of the two you did; they are not equally trustworthy.

### Step 3 — Change one thing

Edit the skill, then re-run the cases. **Change one rule per round.** Two edits and a moved
number leave you unable to attribute the difference, which is how skills accumulate rules that
never helped.

### Step 4 — Grade against the case, not against your taste

For each case record `pass` / `fail` / `unclear`, and for a fail, *which sentence in the skill
should have prevented it*. If no sentence exists, that is the edit for the next round. If a
sentence exists and was ignored, the problem is placement or emphasis, not content — a rule
buried in a reference file that the skill never tells you to open has not been stated.

`unclear` is a real result and must not be rounded to `pass`.

### Step 5 — Show the user the diff, not the score

Present before/after **for the cases that changed**, in their own words. A table of numbers
answers "did it move"; the pair of outputs answers "is it better", which is the question.

---

## Improving the skill

**Undertriggering is the common failure, not overtriggering.** A skill that never fires costs
its whole value; one that fires unnecessarily costs a few tokens. When a case fails because the
skill was never consulted, the fix is in the `description`, not the body.

**Rules that fire late are worth more than rules that fire early.** A caution at the end of a
long skill is read after the decision it was meant to inform. Move it to the step it governs.

**Prefer a step over a principle.** "Verification errors get caught by nothing" is true and
changes no behaviour. "Break the assertion, watch it fail, restore it" is the same idea as an
action, and it gets done.

### Description optimization, by hand

1. Write 10–15 queries a user might send: some that **should** trigger the skill, some
   deliberately adjacent that should **not**.
2. For each, judge from the description alone whether it would trigger.
3. Rewrite the description to fix the misses, then re-judge the whole set — including the ones
   that already passed, since a broader description can start catching things it should not.

Keep the trigger vocabulary in the `description`; keep the method in the body. Claude decides
whether to open a skill from the description alone, so a trigger phrase in the body is invisible
at the moment it matters.

**Queries must be substantive.** Claude handles simple one-step requests without consulting any
skill, so "read this file" is a poor test case regardless of how well the description matches.

## Packaging

If a `present_files` tool is available, hand the user the skill folder directly. There is no
packaging script in this bundle; do not instruct anyone to run one.

---

## Reference files

- [schemas](references/schemas.md) — JSON structures for test-case and grading files
- [index](references/index.md) — what else lives in this skill
- [project-problem-solver](references/project-problem-solver.md) — diagnosing a skill that is
  technically correct but not helping

---

## The loop, restated

1. Write the cases, with their expected observable behaviour
2. Baseline the current skill against them
3. Change one rule
4. Re-run, grade, record which sentence owns each failure
5. Show the user the before/after pairs
6. Repeat until the cases pass and the user agrees the outputs are better

Put these on your todo list if you keep one. The step people skip is **2** — and skipping it
turns every later comparison into a guess.
