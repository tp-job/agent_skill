# The Feature Loop — sub-tasks and the inner cycle

The six gates run **once per build**. This loop runs **once per feature**, dozens of times, and it is where a long build is actually made or lost.

                                           (full suite at session start
                                            and before the Stage 3 gate)
```

Never skip a box. The loop's value is entirely in its being unbroken — a loop with an optional step is a suggestion.

---

## Regression: full at the edges, scoped in the middle

The full suite runs **twice**: at session bootstrap, and once more before Stage 3 closes. In between, run only the tests touching what you changed.

This is not a weakening. A full suite on every iteration costs quadratic time — forty features against a ten-minute suite is over six hours of re-running tests that nothing touched, which is how the loop stops being run at all. The guarantee is preserved at the edges, where a regression can actually escape.

| When | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Session bootstrap | Full suite. Never build on a red tree. |
| Each loop iteration | Tests covering the files you touched, plus anything declaring `depends_on` this feature |
| Before Stage 3 closes | Full suite again, plus the cross-feature checks in Stage 4 |
| Anything red, ever | Stop. Fix before new work. |

If something breaks, mark the affected feature `"passes": false` immediately — the ledger must match reality even when reality is embarrassing — fix it, and note it in `progress.md`.

**A feature does not stay `true` because it was once `true`.** Passing is a claim about the current tree.

---

## What a good sub-task looks like

A feature in [feature-list.json](../assets/feature-list.template.json) is a **sub-task with its own acceptance test built in.**

```json
{
  "id": "F014",
  "category": "functional",
  "priority": "high",
  "description": "User can reset password via emailed one-time link",
  "steps": [
    "Request reset for a registered email → 200, email queued",
    "Request reset for an unregistered email → 200, no email, no enumeration leak",
    "Follow a valid link → password form renders",
    "Follow an expired link (>30 min) → clear error, no form",
    "Reuse a consumed link → rejected"
  ],
  "depends_on": ["F008"],
  "passes": false,
  "notes": ""
}
```

| Rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| One feature = one commit = one working state | If it can't be committed working, it's two features |
| 3–7 verification steps | Fewer means under-specified; more means it's really several features |
| Steps are observable, not internal | "Returns 401" not "calls the auth middleware" — you must be able to *run* the step |
| At least one failure case | A feature verified only on the happy path is verified nowhere |
| Declare `depends_on` | A feature whose dependency is failing **is not selectable** |

### Priority rubric

Assign by consequence, not by enthusiasm:

| | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `critical` | Nothing else works without it — bootstrap, auth, the data layer |
| `high` | On the primary user journey; the build is not shippable without it |
| `medium` | Expected, but a workaround exists |
| `low` | Polish. Cut it without renegotiating scope |

### Categories

`core` (scaffolding, environment) · `functional` (behavior a user invokes) · `ui` (screens and states) · `style` (visual polish) · `integration` (crossing a boundary — service, third party, another feature) · `performance` (a stated numeric target) · `security` (a trust boundary; see invariant 9)

---

## How much to specify up front

Write the **critical path in full** — roughly the first 10–15 features, complete with verification steps. **Stub the rest**: description, category, priority, and `"steps": []`.

You cannot write honest verification steps for feature 47 before feature 3 exists; pretending otherwise produces steps that get quietly loosened later, which is the exact failure invariant 1 exists to stop. But an unwritten feature is a forgotten feature, so the scope still gets listed.

**A feature with no steps cannot be marked passing.** That single rule makes the stub self-correcting: specification happens at the moment you actually know enough, and it happens before the work rather than after.

What Stage 1–2 fix is the **acceptance criteria**, not the implementation plan. Criteria should be stable; the feature list is expected to grow. Growth is discovery working; a drifting acceptance criterion is the build going wrong.

---

## Selection order

1. Anything **red** — a failing regression outranks all new work, always.
2. `critical` → `high` → `medium` → `low`.
3. Within a priority: unblocked before blocked, and prefer features building on already-passing ones.
4. Announce the pick in one line: *"Now working on F014: password reset via emailed link."*

Never carry two features in flight. Parallel half-features are how a tree reaches a state no one can commit and no one can revert.

**One exception — the small-feature batch.** Up to three features may share a commit when all of them are the same category, each is under ~10 lines, and **each is verified individually against its own steps**. Five copy strings do not deserve five commits. Verification never batches; only the bookkeeping does. List every ID in the commit message.

---

## Verification: the part that gets faked

The most common failure of a long-running agent is declaring victory. Guardrails:

- Verify **end to end, through the real interface** — the interface your consumer actually touches:

  | Kind of thing | The real interface |
  | --- | --- |
  | Web UI | A browser. Click, type, screenshot, check the console |
  | API | An actual HTTP call. Status, body shape, error paths |
  | CLI | Run the command. Check stdout and the exit code |
  | Library | The public API, imported from a separate test package — not internal calls |
  | Data pipeline | The output artifact, produced from a real input |
  | Compiler / codegen | Compile *and run* the emitted output |

- A `curl` succeeding is not a UI working. A unit test passing is not a feature working.
- Never script around the interface you are supposed to be testing.
- Mark `passes: true` only when **every** step passed. Not most.

BAD: *"Implemented password reset. The endpoint returns 200, so F014 passes."*

BETTER: *"F014: ran all 5 steps. Step 4 (expired link) returned 500 instead of a clean error — fixed, re-ran, now 410 with a message. All 5 pass. Screenshot of the expired-link state attached."*

---

## Refactor: the last box, not an optional one

Verification passing is not the end of the iteration. It is the moment the cleanup becomes *safe*, and it is the last moment you will have this much context on this diff. A build that skips this box passes every gate and still degrades — one small, individually-forgivable mess at a time.

Refactor **after** green, never before. Cleaning code you have not yet verified means you cannot tell a refactoring mistake from an implementation mistake, and you will debug both at once.

### The scope rule

**Only what this feature touched.** The boundary is the feature's own diff — the files you changed, the functions you added, the seams you cut. Not "the module while I'm here", not the neighbouring class that has always bothered you.

| In scope | Out of scope |
| --- | --- |
| Duplication *this feature* introduced | Duplication that predates it |
| Dead code left over from your own attempts | Dead code someone else left |
| Names that drifted from the target's vocabulary | Renaming across the codebase |
| Scaffolding you added to make verification easy | Restructuring a module you merely read |
| A function this feature grew past readable | A long function you did not touch |

Anything out of scope that genuinely needs doing becomes **a `core` feature on the ledger** with its own verification steps. That is not a deferral tactic — it is the difference between debt you tracked and debt you absorbed silently.

### The three rules

1. **No behavior change.** If behavior changes, it is not a refactor. It is a new feature or a bug fix, and it goes on the ledger with its own steps.
2. **Re-run the feature's own verification steps afterward.** Not a subset, not "it obviously still works". The refactor is not done until the same steps that went green before go green again. This is the entire safety argument for doing it here rather than later.
3. **Stop when the cleanup is bigger than the feature.** If the tidy-up would exceed the change that prompted it, you have found a `core` feature, not a refactor. File it and move on.

### What to actually look for

Ordered by how much they cost if left:

| Look for | Why it matters here |
| --- | --- |
| **Duplication you just created** | This is where the fourth copy of a utility is born — one plausible local decision at a time |
| **The seam you cut in a hurry** | An interface written to get the test passing is an interface everything downstream will bind to |
| **Scaffolding and debug residue** | Console logs, hardcoded fixtures, the temporary flag you added to reach a branch |
| **Names that drifted** | The target says `resetToken`, the code says `tmpKey`; a vocabulary mismatch survives into every future search |
| **A branch you never simplified** | The nested conditional that grew while you were chasing the edge case |

### Commit boundary

The refactor lands **in the feature's own commit**, because it is part of that feature's working state and one feature = one commit = one working state. If a cleanup feels large enough to want its own commit, that is the signal it was large enough to be its own ledger feature — see rule 3.

BAD: *"F014 passes. Committing."* — with the debug logging still in, and the token helper duplicated because the existing one was two directories away.

BETTER: *"F014: all 5 steps pass. Refactor — removed the debug logging, folded my `makeToken` into the existing `lib/tokens.ts` helper, renamed `tmpKey` to `resetToken` to match the spec. Re-ran all 5 steps, still green. Committing."*

---

## Commit discipline

Commit **immediately** after verification passes, before anything else starts. Stage the paths you changed — not `-A`, which sweeps whatever else is sitting in the tree.

```bash
git add src/auth/reset.ts src/auth/reset.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(F014): password reset via emailed one-time link

- Implemented: token issue, 30-min expiry, single-use consumption
- Tested: all 5 verification steps incl. expired + reused link
- Notes: reuses the token store from F008"
```

Confirm it landed: `git status` clean, `git log --oneline -1` shows it. **A feature without a commit does not exist** — it is an uncommitted diff the next context window will not know about and may destroy.

---

## When a feature is blocked

Don't grind. After **three distinct approaches** to the same blocker:

1. Write the blocker into `notes` — specifically, not "hard".
2. Add it to `progress.md`.
3. If the blocker is itself a bug, file it as a new feature and set the original's `depends_on`.
4. Move to the next unblocked feature.

After **three completed implement→verify cycles** on the same feature, stop and return to the user. Re-read the requirement and the design first; if both are sound, the problem is genuinely hard and wants a fresh session, not a fourth attempt with exhausted context.
